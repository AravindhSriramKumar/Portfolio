          During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects wherein I honed my frontend development skills by creating a user-friendly interface for an automation tool using React.js. I also gained experience in backend development by integrating the frontend with a Python backend using Flask and Electron. Additionally, I delved into data collection and analysis, utilizing a photodarlington sensor and Arduino board to contribute to a machine learning project. Finally, I gained a solid understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
